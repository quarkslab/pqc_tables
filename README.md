# PQC tables

The goal of the following tables is to summarize the [ANSSI](#ANSSI) recommandations regarding post-quantum cryptography scheme usages for (French) certifications. These tables are subject to change depending on new cryptanalysis, new submitted algorithms to the [NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography), new recommandations, etc. The simplified tables may give a quick overview of the ANSSI recommandations, while the larger tables will give more information, in particular about the sizes of the private key (sk), the public key (pk), the ciphertext (ct), the shared secret (ss) and the signature (sig).

## Tables (simplified)

### On the ANSSI column

According to [[ANSSI](#ANSSI)],

> Moreover the conjectured post-quantum level should be as high as possible, preferably NIST level V (AES-256).

> ANSSI encourages to use a conjectured post-quantum security level on symmetric primitives consistent with the selected post-quantum PKC algorithm â€“ in practice at least the same security level as AES-256 for block ciphers and at least the same security level as SHA2-384 for hash functions.

We then consider, in the ANSSI column, that if a cryptographic scheme does not provide security parameters for level IV (at least as hard to break as SHA2-384) or level V (at least as hard to break as AES-256), the scheme is not suitable to be used to get a (French) certification.

## Tables

### Notes

When two values in a cell, first is the one from the documentation, the second from the reference implementation submitted to [Round 3 submission of NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions).

Other tables gathering data on PQC schemes can be found, for example at:

* [Algorithms in liboqs](https://openquantumsafe.org/liboqs/algorithms/);
* [PQC wiki](https://pqc-wiki.fau.edu/w/Special:DatabaseHome).

It is also possible to look for the different `api.h` or `META.yml` of [PQClean](https://github.com/PQClean/PQClean).

> Hash-based signatures are an exception for hybridation: due to their well-studied underlying mathematical problem, ANSSI estimates that these algorithms could be used today without hybridation. However, their potential application range is limited (low number of signatures queries or large signature sizes).
